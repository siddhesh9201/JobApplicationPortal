Job Application Portal is a full-stack backend project built using Spring Boot and MySQL that simulates a real-world job hiring system. It enables users to register either as job seekers or recruiters. Job seekers can search and apply for jobs, while recruiters can post job openings and manage applicants. The system also supports an admin role to manage users and content effectively.
